# Spotify Playlist Creator

Paste a bunch of songs and it will make you a playlist! Ideally, each line would be formatted like "artist - title - album" or even just "artist - title". This format provides the most information about what you're looking for, and therefore most likely to find the best match. Otherwise, you might get Lil' Wayne when you're looking for Tangerine Dream. Seriously. This happened. It may still happen. The system isn't perfect.

I made this app so I could import playlists of my favorite radio show, Dead Electric on KSER, hosted by David Haldeman. Playlists of every show can be found here: https://deadelectricfm.com/playlists/
